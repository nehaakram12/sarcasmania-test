TumblrInAction,"&gt;A webpage set up for the event - which called for ""zero tolerance policies on all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression"" - initially stated that the meeting was ""for all self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include 'woman.'""

First of all WTF is ""self-defining black""?  Can I be transracial?  Isn't that *cultural appropriation*.

Second of all, does ""gender identities that include 'woman.'"" mean that *trans-men* (born a woman; identify as a man) are also banned?

I can agree with ""zero tolerance policies on all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression"".  Goldsmiths should start by expelling Bahar Mustafa for her blatent bigotry.

Edit:  The article never clarified the gender of the organizer, and ""Bahar"" just sounded like a male name.  I am more embarrassed by not noticing the blatant hypocrisy of a man organizing a women-only event had I been correct in my original interpretation.  I have corrected my pronoun.  Thanks /u/BIG_GUY_FOR_YOU for calling me out on my blatant bigotry... /s",13,0,0
